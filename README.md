# MMA-Website-MS1

Overview:

The purpose of this website is to offer a Mixed Martial Arts School in a local town. The reason for this is because MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) is one of the fastest growing sports, if not the fastest growing sport, in the world right now. This is a work of fiction. All images were found on Pixabay and Pexels and ING Image, links to the images used are provided below, the alt-tag is used to identify the images.

SCOPE:

SITE OWNER'S PERSPECTIVE:

1: The user wants a clear informative layout to be able to attract visitors to the site and give them a positive emotional response when interacting with it.

2: The user wants to be able to easily navigate through the site, using a intuititive navigation menu, and a clear informative layout.

3: User's need to be able to find the location of the gym quickly to know if it is easily accessible for them.

4: The user wants to see some validation for the site owners, to know they can be trusted and the site is legit. The use of social media icons and reviews on the site is used as evidence for this.

5: A returning user wants some form of interaction between them and the site, as well as a means of contact them, the use of the contact form is used ofr both these purposes as it enables the user to interact with the site and also contact the organisation with any questions or queries they may have.

6: A returning user also needs to find out training times.

SITE OWNER'S PERSPECTIVE:

1: The site has been made for a MMA Gym, due to the sport's rapidly increasing popularity.

2: The site is mobile friendly and shoud look good across all screen sizes.

3: The use of the contact form on the sign up page is used as a way of interaction between the client and the user.

4: The social media links in the footer act as a way of validating that this company is reliable and trustworthy.

5: The navigation menu should be clear and informative, the site layout should have good design, and also present the information available in a easy to read manner, making the site intuitive to use.

DESIGN:

COLOR'S: The main color's used for Eastbourne Warrios are grey and white. 

Typography: the 2 main fonts are Impact and Montserrat. Roboto is used on the footer to add a bit more diversity with the tpography, while making the form stand out a lttle bit more.

Images: The images come from a mixture of pexels, pixabay and ING Image. They are used to give an idea of the Martial Art itself, and the various striking/grappling techniques.

Wireframes: A mockup of the site was built in balsamiq, and can be viewed here.



Languages used: HTML and CSS.

Frameworks: Balsamiq was used to create a wireframe mock up of the site.
            Bootstrap 5 is used for the responsive menu, and to help with the overall responsiveness of the site.
            JQuery is used to make the menu responsive.
            Hover.css was used on the icons in the footer to add a little bit of animation to the page, and lift the design a bit.
            Google fonts was used to import the Montserrat Roboto and fonts, which are used as the main paragraph text throughout the page, and in the footer respectively.
            Font Awesome was used to include the four icons in the footer, the main purpose of these is to make the footer look a bit more dynamic.
            Git was used to preview the site, and also to push and pull changes to GitHub, as well as commit to Git.
            GitHub is used to store the code, after it has been pushed from Git.
            
            
DESIGN PROCESS:

The logo in the top left, is clickable, and returns to the homepage, this adds to the ease of use, and is in keeping with the design. The font family is called "Impact" this wasn't one of the fonts I imported from Google fonts, it's one of the pre-installed ones in GitPod. I choose Impact, because of the impact somoene has on the punchbag when it is hit, and the style of the font seemed in keeping with the general feel or sound of a MMA Gym's site, ie: one of power.

To make the site's purpose clear from the outset, I used an image portraying a boxing class with the alt tag of: "boxing" to highlight this is a MMA gym, as well as placing a heading 1 text with the name of the gym (Eastbourne Warriors) on top of the image, to clearly state the name of the organisation, and show what they do. The use of the heading 3 subheading, is used to say what the site is about and define the purpose of the site, as well as give a location, in this case Easbourne.

The sites middle section consists of BootStrap cards. Originally, it was going to be two different layouts, one for tablet and desktop, and one for mobile. The mobile one was going to be the bootsrap cards, and the tablet and desktop one, was going to be some images with a hover effect, so when you hovered over them, you saw the about text for that particular class/image. I couldn't use the hover for mobile, as this would interfere with UX on mobile, having text appear when trying to scroll for example. However, due to time constraints and also issues with the image sizes,the original tablet/desktop layout couldn't be done, so BootStrap cards are used to create a decent design, while also not impacting the UX. 

The footer consists of a contact form, a address and social media section. These all provide ways to contact/connect with the site owner, and hopefuly make the user of the site see that this is a legit organisation (the use of social media icons is especially good for this as images and posts can be seen from the people themselves, instead of just sending off a contact request which the user may wonder if it may or may not reach the organisation.) The address is for an industrial estate, while this may be off putting, many gyms can be found on industrial estates in Eastbourne, there is one real-life rock climbing gym in Eastbourne for example, that is based on a industrial estate. Please note the address used here is  a fake address, it is just used in keeping with how other gyms are run in Eastbourne.  

TESTING: 

The site code has been tested in W3C MarkUp Validator and W3C CSS Validator. 

The site has undergone extensive testing, with every change being carefully previewed in the browser before being pushed to GitHub onto the deployed version. Any bugs have been attempted to being resolved quickly before moving onto another section. 

Web dev debugging tools such as Chrome Web Dev tools and Mozilla FireFox Web Dev tools have been used to try to resolve any bugs. 

The site has been viewed on a 30 inch desktop monitor, a 15 inch laptop, a iPhone SE 2020 and iPad 8th generation. 

Friends and family have also critisized the design, layout and UX of the site on various devices, such as: an iMac 2016, iPad 7th generation, iPhone SE 2016, and a Kindle Fire HD 8.

KNOWN BUGS:

When using the toggle menu on mobile, the header text jumps onto the menu. I have tried: setting min/max heights to both menu and header, changing the positioning of the text from relative to absolute,fixed, re-reading the BootStrap 5 Documentation, tutor support, and asked on slack. Nothing has been able to resolve this bug. 

The site does take a while to load. This is due to large image files. To try to correct this, images have been resized in: photoshop, and file size has also attempted to be minimised on several sites such as: TinyPNG, and Free Image Optimizer.
